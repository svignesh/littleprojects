                                     In the book Charlotte's Web by E.B.white Wilbur is a pig who grew up on a little girls house but then had to be sold to the Zuckermans. He was sold to the Zukermans and then Wilbur eskaped. After they got him back they went to the farm  Wilbur was happy there for a wile but when he asked for the other animals to play they were all mean to him and didn't want to play. So every other day he didnt eat and he was feeling lonly. One night he herd a little voice and that will be his new freind. In the morning he herd the sam litle voice and it said "salutations". Wilburs new freind was a spider. Her name was Charlotte. They didnt get olong at first but when times past they were reley close. One day the the old sheep said  wilbur would be killed on cristmas for meat. Charlotte did every thing she could do. She even got wilbur to go to the fair to get the prize money for best pig in the fair. After that Wilbur wasnt killed but Charlotte was because she layed eggs and most spiders die after that and she was helping Wilbur. Then her children hatched and she asked Wilbur to look after them. All of them left exept for 3. They wantd to stay with Wilbur.
