She was on a boat but then was washed away on shoar and was in a crate and activated herself and got out. But then she got out and saw otters. Then she went to an island  and climbed to the top. Then she saw some bears. She was making nois outside there cave so the bears chased her and ros went up a tree. After every animal thought ros was a monster. Then ros studyd the animals vioces and began learning them. she saw a bug camofloge s she thought she should do the same. one day she saw a fox that got hurt so she helped him. After there was a rockslide and in a nest there were bird egg and because of the rockslide only one egg surived. ros took care of the egg. then the egg hatched and the gosling needed food so ros went to a grown up goos to ask what she should feed him. the goos said to feed him bugs. Ros named him brightbill. after brightbill began to swim but ros couldn't swim with him.then there was a fish who tried to kill him. the goos protected him. after the went home brightbill made a new freind. his name was chitchat. the played all day.then he learned to fly. then brightbill asked his mother to show him the dead robots. ros said no but after he asked agen ros said yes after they got there he saw all of the robots. Then they saw a button on rozs head on the back and brightbill clicked it. roz was deactivated and then she was back to normal when brightbill activaed her. After they went home they threw a partey but in the middle 3 other robots came. there names were reco 1 reco 2 and reco 3. they were here to take roz back to the humans. But the animals fought them. reco 3 and 2 were destroyed but reco 1 was alive but then dead. roz was without legs and hands so she needed to go to the humans but roz will return agen.
